## Standards

### Chess Engine Communication Protocol
https://www.chessprogramming.org/Chess_Engine_Communication_Protocol

Noted: The majority of new chess engines don't support it

### Universal Chess Interface
Noted: While the UCI design makes it simple for engine programmers to integrate a "stateless" chess engine, it was also disputed by various chess programmers, since it subsumes engine control parameters and delegates possibly game decisive stuff to the GUI.
